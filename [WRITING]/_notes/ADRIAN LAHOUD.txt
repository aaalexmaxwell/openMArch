THE THIRD DEGREE:
PLANETARY SCALE AND
CLIMATE POLITICS
On 8 December 2009 during the
Copenhagen Climate Summit,
Lumumba Di-Aping, the Sudanese
negotiator representing the G77
utters a distinctly un-diplomatic
phrase: ‘We have been asked to sign
a suicide pact’. The phrase is uttered
in reference to the so called ‘Dutch
text’ and its proposed 2 C global
average temperature increase.
Breaking all protocols, Di-Aping’s
radical act of dissidence carries into 
public speech the reality of a private
calculus and its implicit presup
-
position: the differential scale of
anthropogenic impact. Beginning
with Di-Aping’s dissident utterance
and locating it within contempo
-
rary scientific debates on climate
modelling, this paper will address
the issue of climate change through
the problem of scale and scalar
politics. Moving beyond questions
of sustainability, it will argue that
the distance between scientific
and political questions can only
be maintained by obscuring the
economic war over access to global
carbon capacity and the uneven
scale and effect of temperature
increase that results from it.
