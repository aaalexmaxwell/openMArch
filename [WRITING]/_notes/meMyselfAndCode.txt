I can code. If you were to ask me, that is what I will tell you. But i cannot actually prove it. I don't have a certificate that proves i completed a course were i learned to code.

Perhaps I could give a piece of code that I have written. But how do you know i wrote it? Can someone verify it, identify my writing style? I am not sure that I can.

And how would you know that it was all my own work? What if i have used parts of someone else's code in my own? And what if the part of the code that i have taken, whilst not significant in my own, represents the majority of the other persons? My code doesn't have references of footnotes.

What if we sat down and you watched my code something, from scratch? But maybe i am just regurgitating something that i have remembered? How would you know? Maybe you could come up with something for me to code and then see if i can do?

That could be tricky though - . I never said i could code everything. For example, I can write a genetic algorithm, or an artificial neural network. But to be honest, I am not that good at web design, so it would be best if you didn't ask me about that.

One of the programming languages i know doesn't really exist anymore. Sure, there are some survivors still clinging onto it. And you can here echoes of it in other places - familiar words, phrases. But it is basically dead. I still have the code that i wrote, but i can't show you it. Well, I mean, I can show you the code, but i can't run it, it doesn't do anything.

Well, this is a bit awkward. But I can code. Honestly.
