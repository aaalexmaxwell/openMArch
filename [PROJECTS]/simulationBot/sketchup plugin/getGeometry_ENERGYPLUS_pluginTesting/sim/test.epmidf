! ASHRAE_2005_HOF_Materials.idf
!
! This file contains content from two chapters in the ASHRAE 2005 Handbook of
! Fundamentals, Chapter 30 - the Cooling and Heating Loads calculations chapter
! has both materials with thermal properties and constructions for Light, Medium,
! and Heavy buildings.  Chapter 25 contains details thermal properties of many
! materials -- no constructions are created from that data.
!===============================================================================
! HOF Materials and Constructions, Chapter 30
! The following materials and constructions are created from
! ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals, 2005, Chapter 30, Table 19 and Table 22.
! These are representative of materials and constructions used in
! Cooling and Heating Load Calculations.
